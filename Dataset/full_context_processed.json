I am having trouble making `SumIsEven()` work, and I think I have just managed to make it too complicated to easily debug. Can you help me convert it into an if/else control flow?\nTeacher: Hello! I would be more than glad to help you with that. I notice your first line is already returning a boolean value, what if we use that as a condition for our `if` statement? First, let's simplify the problem so it's easier to look at. Can you store `a+b` in a temporary variable?\nStudent: Okay! I've put the sum of a and b into the temporary variable `inputSum` and gone ahead and converted the return into an if/else but it's still not working as intended. Can you give me more guidance?\nTeacher: Could the problem be that your condition is checking for an odd number instead of an even number? How can you adjust the condition in your if statement to check for even numbers?\n\n"

I need help, my code seems to always create dictionary values that contain only one element, which works for the first test case, but not for the rest. Can you help?\nTeacher: Sure. Let's try to see what happens with your dictionary values during the execution of the program. Inside the for loop, after line 4, can you add code that prints the key and the value stored in `results[key]`? Then evaluate the function on the list `[(1, 2), (1, 3)]` and tell me what you notice.\n\t<alt>Sure. Can you evaluate the function twice, once on the list `[(1, 2), (1, 3)]`, and once on `[(1, 3), (1, 2)]`? Then see if you notice anything interesting.\n\t<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case, your code does not work well for keys that appear multiple times as the first elements in the input tuples. Can you say what happens on line 4 in your code the second time it sees 6 as a key? What is already stored in `result[key]` before line 4 is executed, and what will be stored in `result[key]` after line 4 is executed?\n\t<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case, let's say that the variable `results` already maps the key 2 to value `[7]`. What happens in line 4 when the variable `key` is 2 and the variable `value` is 5? To what value will the `result` map the key 2 after executing line 4?\n\t<alt>Sure. Can you go through your code line by line and explain to me what each line is supposed to do?\n\t<alt>Sure. Do you notice anything different about the second and third test cases that makes your code output the wrong result, when compared with the first test case?\n\t<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case and your code output for it, what is the value that it includes for key 2 in the result and what are the values that it ignores for the same key?\n\t<alt>Sure. Let me ask you a warm-up question first. If you have a variable `a` that is initially assigned the value `[1]`, e.g., `a = [1]`, what value will it have after you evaluate the new assignment statement `a = [2]`?\n\t<alt>Sure. Let me ask you a warm-up question first. If you have a variable `a` that is initially assigned the value `1`, e.g., `a = 1`, what value will it have after you evaluate the new assignment statement `a = 2`?\nStudent: I did that and I think I see what the problem is. When the code encountered the value 3, instead of appending it to the list of previous values, it created a new list...\nTeacher: Good observation.
